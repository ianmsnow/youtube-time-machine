====================

Youtube’s time machine isn’t the kind where you can jump inside and travel through time.  They are manufacturing video that outpaces actual time by 6,000 times.  That means you would need 6,000 days to watch all the video uploaded today.  If you watched Youtube videos for your ENTIRE life (24×7), you’d only be able to watch a little over 4 days worth of uploads.
